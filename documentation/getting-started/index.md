This guide provides a quick introduction into setting up SignPath and using it to sign your code. Please note that for open source projects, additional steps are necessary.

To get started with SignPath, you need to follow these steps:

1. [Create or import certificates](/documentation/managing-certificates)
2. [Invite your team](/documentation/users) to join your organization
3. [Configure your project and define your process](/documentation/projects)
4. [Sign your code artifacts](/documentation/signing-code)

In order to become an advanced user, you can read a detailed description on how to [configure your artifact configuration](/documentation/artifact-configuration) and how to [integrate SignPath into your automated build processes](/documentation/build-system-integration).
